# Paleoclimate-Time-Series

## What is this?

The scripts herein chiefly use the output of an depth-age model (e.g. Oxcal) to plot time series proxy records including age uncertainties. 

The fundamental approach is taken from COPRA [1]:
The age uncertainty is obtained from multiple monte-carlo type depth-age model runs and expressed as a 95% confidence interval of possible ages per age interval. This uncertainty is then used to collect a sample of possible proxy values, that fall within this 95% age range based on the depth-age models' ensemble mean. A propability- (or alternatively a kernel-) density function can then be fitted to the sample of proxy values.
By iteratively repeating this fitting process to each time interval, a matrix of proxy propabilities can be generated, where each column represents the propability distribution of proxy values that arises from age uncertainty. In other words: the age uncertainty is projected onto the proxy axis.
